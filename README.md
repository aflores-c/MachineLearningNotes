# MachineLearningNotes
This are notes that I am collecting from various resources to learn machine learning.

- **Algorithms** cotains machine learning algorithms from scratch
- **ML BOOK** contains jupyter notebooks from the book "Hands on Machine Learning Algorithms"
- **BASIC PROJECTS** contains projects to start with machine learning

I hope to collect more resources later.
